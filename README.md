# metahuman-DNA-Blender-interface
Intention is to make reading, editing and writing dna files of metahuman possible in Blender.
# License
Since this is a Blender addon, it has to go with with [GPL licence](LICENSE). 
Mean while the usage of assets and resources related to Epic's metahuman must follow [Epic's license](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/blob/main/LICENSE).
TBH, I have no idea about correctly licensing.
